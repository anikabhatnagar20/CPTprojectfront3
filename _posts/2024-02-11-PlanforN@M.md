## Book Recommendation
- We are presenting a book reccomendation website. The page opens with a login, if there isn't an account already the user can use the "register" to create an account. Which will link to a home page, that has 3 buttons that link to each specific feature. 

## Anika: 
- Created a login/signup page: 
This allows user to create an account if they don't have one already. And when they have an account they can access all the features and pick up where they specifcally left off. 

 <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/lmc-login'>Link to login</a>

- Home page: 
This page will open once the user has logged and will allow the user to access the main features we have.
